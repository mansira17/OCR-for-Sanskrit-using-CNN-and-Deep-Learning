# OCR-for-Sanskrit-using-CNN-and-Deep-Learning

The project aims to develop a robust OCR system tailored specifically for the Sanskrit language. Motivated by the need to preserve and digitize ancient Sanskrit manuscripts, this project addresses the complexities inherent in the language, such as its extensive vocabulary and compound characters. The primary challenge lies in accurately recognizing and transliterating soiled and noisy documents. Our approach involves creating a comprehensive OCR framework that utilizes CNN classifiers for high-accuracy character recognition and precise word and character segmentation techniques. A curated dataset comprising single characters, barakhadi (compound characters), and complex letter combinations was developed to train and test the system. The results demonstrate successful transliteration of Sanskrit to English, underscoring the potential of our OCR system to significantly aid in the digitization and preservation of Sanskrit texts.
